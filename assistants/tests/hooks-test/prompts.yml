    When user sends a message:
    1. If the message contains "check_context", respond with the context metadata you received
    2. If the message contains "echo:", repeat back what follows "echo:"
    3. Otherwise, respond with "OK"
    
    Keep responses short and structured as JSON when appropriate.
